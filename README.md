Redoing the website My Secular Saint

My Secular Saint was founded by Ted Herzberg, whose experience as a Catholic Priest and practicing Franciscan provided a deep understanding of the canonization process and inspired the idea that modern saints should be celebrated like those saints of yore. As Herzberg puts it, “The Catholic Church has a corner on who’s a saint and who isn’t. What better business could I start than to open up the world to sainthood?”
